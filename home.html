                Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell(born December 18, 2001) is an American singer-songwriter. She first gained attention in 2015 when she uploaded the song "Ocean Eyes" to SoundCloud, which was subsequently released by the Interscope Records subsidiary Darkroom. The song was written and produced by her brother Finneas O'Connell, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. Her debut EP, Don't Smile at Me (2017), became a sleeper hit, reaching the top 15 in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Eilish's debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and became one of the best-selling albums of 2019. It reached number-one in the UK. The album's fifth single "Bad Guy" became her first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2020, she performed the theme song "No Time to Die" for the James Bond film of the same name, which became her first number-one single in the UK. "Everything I Wanted", "My Future", and "Therefore I Am" peaked within the top 10 in the US and UK.
